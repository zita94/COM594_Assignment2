For this assignment, I was tasked with creating an Android application to retrieve and store movie information.

The app enables users to:
<ul>
  <li>Create a review of a movie they watched which is stored in a local database using Room</li>
  <li>Search the local DB by movie title or by actor name. All matching results are displayed</li>
  <li>Query The Open Movie Database using Volley to retrieve all movies that match a given title</li>
  <li>To retrieve the artwork for any given title from OMDb</li>
</ul>

The screenshots below show the application running, as well as some specific additional features like the data validation and the number keypad being used when appropriate for improved UX.

Unfortunately, the functionality and UI constraints for this assignment were very strict, so I'd like to go back and modernise the functionality and UI in the future.
